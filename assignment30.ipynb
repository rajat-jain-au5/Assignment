    "Levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement, refer to the types of data that can be collected in research. \n",
    "There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "1) Nominal Level of Measurement:\n",
    "Nominal level data are categorical or qualitative data that are not ranked or ordered in any way. The data can be put into categories or groups \n",
    "based on some characteristic or feature. Examples of nominal level data include gender, race, religion, and nationality. For instance, the variable\n",
    "\"gender\" can be either male or female, but there is no inherent order or rank between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Ordinal Level of Measurement:\n",
    "Ordinal level data are data that can be ranked or ordered based on some characteristic or feature, but the intervals between each value are\n",
    "not necessarily equal. For example, survey responses to the question, \"How satisfied are you with your job?\" could be ranked as very satisfied, \n",
    "somewhat satisfied, neutral, somewhat dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied. Here, each category represents a level of satisfaction, but the distance \n",
    "between \"very satisfied\" and \"somewhat satisfied\" may not be the same as the distance between \"neutral\" and \"somewhat satisfied\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Interval Level of Measurement:\n",
    "Interval level data are numerical data that can be ordered, and the intervals between each value are equal. However, the data do not have a true zero point,\n",

    "the difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as the difference between 30°C and 40°C, but there is no true zero point in Celsius or Fahrenheit scales.\n",

    "4) Ratio Level of Measurement:\n",
    "Ratio level data are numerical data that have a true zero point, meaning that ratios between values are meaningful. Examples of ratio level data\n",
    "include height, weight, and time. For example, if someone weighs 60 kg and another person weighs 30 kg, the ratio of their weights is 2:1, which \n",
    "means that one person's weight is twice that of the other person's weight."
