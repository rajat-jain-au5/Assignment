    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",

    "Lasso Regression, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression technique that aims to identify and select the most \n",

    "The primary difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, including Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, is that \n",
    "Lasso Regression includes a penalty term that encourages the model to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients of the independent variables towards zero. This penalty\n",

    "Another key difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques is that Lasso Regression is particularly effective when there are many independent \n",

    "Alpha (α): This is a regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term in the Lasso regression equation. Higher values of alpha increase the\n",
