    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to test for significant differences between the means of three or more groups. There are several a\n",
    "ssumptions that must be met to use ANOVA properly. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Independence: The observations within each group are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Normality: The distribution of the dependent variable is normal (i.e., approximately bell-shaped) within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the dependent variable is equal across all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Random sampling: The groups are formed from randomly selected samples from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violations of these assumptions can impact the validity of the ANOVA results. Here are some examples of how each assumption violation can impact the validity of the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: Violations of independence occur when the observations within one group are dependent on the observations within another group. This can occur when \n",
    "participants are matched or when repeated measures are taken on the same participants. The violation of independence can lead to an increased risk of a Type I error\\\n",
    "(i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: If the distribution of the dependent variable is not approximately normal within each group, it can impact the validity of the ANOVA results. \n",
    "Non-normality can lead to a biased estimate of the group means, which can affect the accuracy of the ANOVA results."

    "Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "The partitioning of variance in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) refers to the process of decomposing the total variance of a set of data into different components or \n",
