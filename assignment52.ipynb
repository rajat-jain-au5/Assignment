    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines the advantages of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It is used for feature selection and \n",
    "regularization to avoid overfitting in the presence of multicollinearity, which is when independent variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elastic Net Regression model involves adding a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function. The regularization term includes both the L1\n",
    "norm (sum of absolute values of coefficients) and the L2 norm (sum of squares of coefficients). The strength of regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter alpha,\n",
    "which balances the contribution of the L1 and L2 norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression adds only the L2 regularization term to the cost function, whereas Lasso Regression adds only the L1 regularization term. Elastic Net Regression \n",
    "combines both L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is useful when there are many correlated features, as it tends to select groups of correlated features together. Lasso Regression tends to \n",
    "select only one feature from a group of highly correlated features, whereas Ridge Regression tends to select all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of alpha in Elastic Net Regression controls the trade-off between the L1 and L2 norms. When alpha is set to zero, Elastic Net Regression reduces to OLS \n",
    "regression. When alpha is set to one, Elastic Net Regression is equivalent to Lasso Regression. When alpha is between zero and one, Elastic Net Regression strikes a \n",

    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression involves tuning two hyperparameters: alpha and lambda. Alpha controls the \n",
    "balance between the L1 and L2 regularization terms, while lambda controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common approaches for selecting optimal values of these hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search: In this method, you define a range of values for alpha and lambda, and then perform a cross-validation (CV) for each combination of hyperparameters. The\n",
    "combination that yields the best CV score is selected as the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Search: This method is similar to Grid Search, but instead of trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters, you randomly sample from the defined range of\n",
    "values. This approach can be more efficient than Grid Search when the search space is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian Optimization: This is an advanced method that uses a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different hyperparameters. The model is updated after \n",
    "each iteration based on the results of the CV. The hyperparameters that maximize the expected improvement of the model are selected as the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Some machine learning libraries provide automated hyperparameter tuning algorithms, such as scikit-learn's GridSearchCV and\n",
    "RandomizedSearchCV. These algorithms automate the process of hyperparameter tuning and can save a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the method used, it is important to perform cross-validation to ensure that the selected hyperparameters generalize well to new data. The optimal \n",
    "hyperparameters will depend on the specific dataset and the problem being solved, so it is recommended to experiment with different methods and parameters to find the\n",
    "best combination for your specific problem."
