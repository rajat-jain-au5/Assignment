    "The Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance are two common distance metrics used in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to measure the distance between two \n",

    "Euclidean distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences between each coordinate of two data points. It is also known as the \n",
