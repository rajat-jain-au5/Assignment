    "Q1. What is hierarchical clustering, and how is it different from other clustering techniques?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that aims to create a hierarchy of nested clusters, where each cluster is a subset of the previous cluster. Unlike \n",
    "other clustering techniques such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance. Instead, the \n",
    "algorithm starts with each data point as its own cluster and then iteratively merges the most similar clusters until only one cluster remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering can be divided into two main types: agglomerative and divisive clustering. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own \n",
    "cluster and then successively merges the most similar pairs of clusters until all data points are in a single cluster. Divisive clustering, on the other hand, starts \n",
    "with all data points in a single cluster and then recursively divides the cluster into smaller clusters until each cluster contains only one data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering has several advantages. First, it does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, \n",
    "making it a more flexible method. Second, the resulting dendrogram provides a visual representation of the clustering process, allowing for easier interpretation of the\n",

    "The two main types of hierarchical clustering algorithms are agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative clustering: Agglomerative clustering starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster and then iteratively merging the two closest clusters until \n",
    "all data points belong to a single cluster. In the beginning, each data point is its own cluster. Then, at each step, the algorithm merges the two closest clusters into \n",
    "a new cluster. This process continues until all data points belong to a single cluster. The distance between two clusters can be calculated using various metrics, such\n",
    "as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. The linkage criterion determines how the distance between clusters is calculated. Some common linkage criteria include \n",
    "single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divisive clustering: Divisive clustering starts with all data points belonging to a single cluster and then iteratively divides the cluster into smaller clusters until\n",
    "each cluster contains only one data point. Unlike agglomerative clustering, divisive clustering requires the initial cluster to be defined, which can be the entire \n",
    "dataset or a subset of the data. At each step, the algorithm splits the cluster into two based on a splitting criterion. One way to perform the split is to find the\n",
