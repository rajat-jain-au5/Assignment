    "Q2.  Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "ans: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential information to the user. It provides a simplified view of complex data structures and systems. The idea behind abstraction is to focus on what the system does, not how it does it. \n",
    "     For example, a computer user does not need to know how the computer is functioning internally to perform basic operations like typing or browsing the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Encapsulation, on the other hand, refers to the process of wrapping data and functions within a single unit or object. The objective of encapsulation is to hide the implementation details from the outside world and protect the internal data from being modified or corrupted. \n",
    "     An example of encapsulation is the use of classes in programming. \n",
    "    \n",
    "     A class encapsulates data and methods related to a particular object, making it easier for the programmer to manipulate and reuse code.\n",
    "     In conclusion, Abstraction focuses on hiding the complexity of a system and presenting only the necessary information, while Encapsulation focuses on wrapping data and functions within a single unit, making it easier to manage and manipulate."

    "Q3.  What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "ans: The abc (Abstract Base Class) module in Python is a module that provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes. It is a module for creating abstract base classes in Python, \n",
    "     which are classes that cannot be instantiated but provide a common interface for their subclasses.\n",
    "     For example, let's say we have a set of classes that represent different types of shapes. We want to enforce a common interface between these classes such as a method to calculate the area and perimeter of the shape. To do this, we create an abstract base class, Shape, and define the interface methods, such as calculate_area and calculate_perimeter, in it. \n",
    "     Now, every class that represents a shape must implement these methods."

    "Q4.  How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "ans: Data abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a data structure or system and only showing the essential information to the user. There are several ways to achieve data abstraction in programming:\n",

    "     a common interface for a set of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3.Abstraction using Modules: Modules in programming allow for abstraction by grouping related functions and data together in a single unit. This allows the programmer to hide the implementation details of a module and only expose \n",
    "     the necessary functions to the user.\n",
