    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data that cannot be easily stored in \n",
    "traditional relational databases. Non-relational databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, graph-based, and column-family,\n",
    "to store and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible data models: MongoDB allows for a flexible data model, enabling you to store data in a JSON-like document format. \n",
    "                         This makes it a preferred choice for applications that require more flexible data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High scalability and performance: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large amounts of data. \n",
    "                                     It also supports high-speed data processing with its in-memory computing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Big data and real-time analytics: MongoDB is ideal for handling big data and real-time analytics because of its ability to store and process large volumes of data quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Agile development: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for agile development, enabling developers to quickly and easily make changes to the data model as needed without \n",
    "                      affecting the application's overall performance.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "ans: \n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides several features to manage unstructured and semi-structured data. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB uses a document data model, which means data is stored in JSON-like documents that can have varying structures. This provides greater flexibility in managing unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to a cluster, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple servers. This ensures that the database can handle large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High Availability: MongoDB supports high availability by replicating data across multiple servers in a cluster. This ensures that the database remains accessible even if one or more servers fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing, which allows for faster data retrieval and search. Indexes can be created on any field in a document, including embedded documents and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Querying: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of operators and functions. This allows for complex queries on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation: MongoDB supports aggregation, which allows for the processing of data in a pipeline of operations. This makes it easier to perform complex calculations and data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ad-hoc queries: MongoDB allows for ad-hoc queries, which means that you can run ad-hoc queries on any field in a document, even if it's not indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Flexible schema: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for agile development and easier management of complex data structures. This means that you can easily add or remove fields from a document without affecting the performance of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding, which allows for the distribution of data across multiple servers. This makes it easier to scale the database horizontally and ensures that the database can handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.MapReduce: MongoDB supports MapReduce, which is a programming model for processing large datasets. This makes it easier to perform complex data processing tasks, such as batch processing and data analysis.\n",
