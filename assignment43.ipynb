    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two common methods for encoding categorical variables into numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a method of encoding categorical variables into ordinal numerical values. This means that the categorical values are mapped to integer values based \n",
    "on their rank or order. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"temperature\" with values \"cold\", \"warm\", and \"hot\", we could map them to the ordinal values 0, \n",
    "1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is a method of encoding categorical variables into non-ordinal numerical values. This means that each categorical value is mapped \n",
    "to a unique integer value. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"fruit\" with values \"apple\", \"banana\", and \"orange\", we could map them to the label values \n",
    "0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of ordinal encoding is that it preserves the order of the categorical variable. This can be useful when the order of the categories is meaningful, such \n",
    "as in the case of temperature. However, it may not be appropriate for categorical variables where there is no inherent order, such as in the case of fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, can be useful when there is no inherent order to the categorical variable. It is also a simpler method of encoding, as each \n",
    "categorical value is mapped to a unique integer value. However, it may not be appropriate when there are a large number of categories, as the resulting encoded \n",
    "values may not be very informative."

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example o when you might use it in\n",

    "ans:\n",
    "Target guided ordinal encoding is a technique for encoding categorical variables based on the target variable. It works by replacing each category with a rank \n",
    "based on the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's consider an example where we have a categorical variable \"city\" and a binary target variable \"churn\" indicating whether a customer has \n",
    "cancelled their subscription or not. We can calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of \"city\" and then rank the categories based on these means. \n",
    "This results in a new numerical variable where each category is replaced with a rank corresponding to the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",

    "city = ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'London', 'Paris', 'New York', 'New York', 'Paris']\n",
    "churn = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of \"city\" as follows:\n",
    "New York: 0.33\n",
    "London: 0.5\n",
    "Paris: 0.67\n",

    "Target guided ordinal encoding can be useful when the categorical variable has a strong relationship with the target variable, and when ordinal encoding is \n",
    "appropriate but the categories do not have a natural order. By incorporating information about the target variable, this encoding technique can potentially improve \n",

    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. Specifically, it measures how much two variables vary together. If the \n",
