    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It maps each possible value of \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, consider a six-sided dice. The PMF of this dice will give the probability of each possible outcome, which are the numbers 1 to 6. The PMF of a fair dice would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=1) = P(X=2) = P(X=3) = P(X=4) = P(X=5) = P(X=6) = 1/6\n",
