    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors?\n",
    "ans: An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It interrupts the normal flow of the program and can be handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "     The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the code is being parsed or compiled, while exceptions occur during the execution of the program.\n",
    "     Exceptions can also be categorized into different types, such as built-in exceptions (e.g. ValueError, TypeError), user-defined exceptions, and system-exiting exceptions (e.g. SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt). \n",
    "     These types of exceptions can be caught and handled differently depending on the requirements of the program."

    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "ans: If an exception is not handled, it will cause the program to terminate abruptly with an error message, and the rest of the program will not be executed. This behavior can be problematic because it leaves the user without any feedback or indication of what went wrong, \n",
    "     making it challenging to diagnose and fix the issue. For example, suppose we have a program that opens a file and reads its contents but encounters an error due to the file not existing or some other reason. If the program does not handle this exception, it will crash \n",
    "     and display an error message to the user, leaving them without any indication of what went wrong or how to fix it. In contrast, if the program had a try-except block to handle the exception,\n",
    "     it could display a more user-friendly message or provide an option to create the file if it does not exist"
