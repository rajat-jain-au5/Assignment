    "ans: Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2  Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "ans: Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, \n",
    "     and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.3  Is Python case-sensitive when dealing with identifier? \n",
    "ans: Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.4  What is correct extension of python file?\n",
    "ans: .py\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5  Is Python code intepreted or compiled?\n",
    "ans: python language is interpreted. But that is half correct the python program is first compiled and then interpreted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6  Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "ans: Indentation is used to define a block of code in python. A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. \n",
    "     Each command typed interactively is a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7  State a character used to give single line comments in python? \n",
    "ans: We can write a single-line comment by adding a single '#' character before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.8  Mention function which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "ans  The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.9  Pyhton supports creation of anonymous function at runtime using a construct called ______ ?\n",
    "ans: lambda\n",
    "\n",

    "Q.12 What is the maximum possible length of identifier in pyhton?\n",
    "ans: An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.13 What are benifits of using python?\n",
    "ans: There are many benifits of using python some points are following:\n",
    "     1. Internet of Things(IoT) Opportunities\n",
    "     2. Large developer community. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n",
    "     3. Extensive libraries. Python offers a wide range of libraries that can be used across various applications.\n",
    "     4. Write less, do more. Python has very concise syntax. ...\n",
    "     5. Object-Oriented and Procedural  Programming language\n",
    "     6. Portable and Interactive\n",
    "     7. Wide range of use cases.\n",
    "     8. Open source and large active community base .\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q.14 How is managed memory in python?      \n",
    "ans: Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. \n",
    "     This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.15 How to install python on windows and set path variables? \n",
    "ans: The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",

    "     4. In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "     5. Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q.16 Is Indentation required in python ?\n",
    "ans: Yes,the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
