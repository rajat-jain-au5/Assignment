    "Here, λ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the regularization, and ||w||₁ is the L1 norm of the weight vector w.\n",
    "\n",

    "L2 Regularization:\n",

    "When choosing the appropriate regularization technique for a deep learning task, several considerations and tradeoffs need to be taken into account. Here are some \n",

    "\n",
    "Problem Complexity: Consider the complexity of the problem you are trying to solve. Some regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, are effective \n",
    "for controlling model complexity and preventing overfitting. They are commonly used as general regularization techniques. However, if the problem is highly complex, additional regularization techniques like Dropout or Batch Normalization may be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Interpretability: Depending on the application, model interpretability may be crucial. Techniques like L1 regularization can help in feature selection by\n",
    "encouraging sparsity, leading to more interpretable models. If interpretability is a priority, consider regularization techniques that promote sparse or structured \n",
    "representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Size: The size of the training dataset is an important consideration. If the dataset is large, overfitting may be less of a concern, and simpler \n",
    "regularization techniques like L2 regularization may be sufficient. However, if the dataset is small, more powerful regularization techniques like Dropout or data \n",
    "augmentation may be necessary to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Resources: Some regularization techniques, such as Dropout or data augmentation, introduce additional computational overhead during training. Dropout,\n",
    "for example, requires multiple forward and backward passes, which can increase training time. Consider the available computational resources and the training time \n",
    "constraints when choosing a regularization technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Requirements: Consider the performance requirements of the deep learning task. Some regularization techniques, like Dropout, can introduce randomness\n",
    "or perturbations during training, which can affect the model's convergence and training stability. If the task requires a highly accurate and stable model,\n",
    "carefully evaluate the impact of the chosen regularization technique on the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevalence in Literature and Community: Regularization techniques have been extensively studied and used in deep learning research and applications. It can be\n",
    "beneficial to consider the prevalence of specific regularization techniques in the literature and the wider community. Techniques with well-established benefits\n",
    "and empirical evidence may provide a more reliable starting point for experimentation."
