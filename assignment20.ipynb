    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",

    "Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites using software or scripts. It involves retrieving and parsing the \n",

    "Web scraping is used to extract data that would be difficult or time-consuming to collect manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some areas where web scraping is commonly used to get data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) E-commerce and price monitoring: Web scraping can be used to extract pricing data, product details, and customer reviews from e-commerce websites. \n",
    "This information can be used to monitor competitors, analyze market trends, and optimize pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Business intelligence and market research: Web scraping can be used to collect data on a company's competitors, such as their product offerings, \n",

    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "ans: \n",
    "There are several methods used for web scraping, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Parsing HTML directly: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a web page directly, using a library or tool such as Beautiful Soup or lxml.\n",
    "                       This method allows for fine-grained control over the scraping process, but can be complex and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Using web scraping frameworks: There are several web scraping frameworks such as Scrapy and Puppeteer that provide a higher level of abstraction and \n",
    "                                  simplify the scraping process. These frameworks typically provide built-in functionality for parsing HTML, handling HTTP requests, \n",
    "                                  and storing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Scraping data through APIs: Some websites provide APIs that allow developers to access data in a structured format. This method can be faster and more efficient \n",
    "                               than parsing HTML directly, but requires knowledge of the API and may be subject to rate limits or other restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Headless browsers: A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface, used to interact with web pages programmatically. Tools such as\n",
    "                      PhantomJS and Selenium can be used to scrape web pages using headless browsers, allowing for dynamic rendering of JavaScript and user interaction \n",
    "                      with web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Screen scraping: This method involves capturing and processing images of a web page to extract data. This method is less common than the others and can be more \n",
