    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another format that can be easily processed, transmitted, or stored. Encoding is essential in data science because it enables the efficient use of data, reduces storage requirements, and facilitates data transmission and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of data encoding, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Text Encoding: This type of encoding converts text from one character encoding system to another, such as from ASCII to Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Numeric Encoding: Numeric encoding converts data from one numerical format to another, such as from binary to decimal or hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Image Encoding: Image encoding converts image data from one format to another, such as from JPEG to PNG.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Audio Encoding: Audio encoding converts audio data from one format to another, such as from MP3 to WAV.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, data encoding is useful in various applications such as data compression, data encryption, and data storage. It is also useful for data preprocessing, \n",
    "where raw data is transformed into a format suitable for analysis. For example, converting categorical variables into numerical variables using one-hot encoding, label \n",
    "encoding, or binary encoding can make the data suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Nominal encoding is a type of categorical encoding that assigns a unique integer or numeric value to each category or level of a categorical variable. The assigned \n",
    "values have no inherent order or magnitude; they are simply used to represent the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset of animal types, and we want to encode the categorical variable \"animal\" into numerical values. We can use nominal encoding to \n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how nominal encoding could be used in a real-world scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a company wants to analyze customer data to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior. One of the variables in the data is \"customer type\", which \n",
    "can take on several categorical values such as \"new customer\", \"loyal customer\", \"regular customer\", and so on. The company wants to perform analysis using machine \n",
