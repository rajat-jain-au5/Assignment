    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that introduces a regularization term in the objective function to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent \n",
    "overfitting. It differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in that OLS seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals, while Ridge regression seeks to \n",
    "minimize the sum of squared residuals plus a penalty term proportional to the sum of the squared coefficients (also known as L2 regularization).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge regression, the penalty term is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter, usually denoted as lambda (λ). The larger the value of λ,\n",
    "the greater the degree of regularization applied to the model, and the smaller the values of the coefficients. The optimal value of λ is typically selected using \n",
    "cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the L2 penalty term, Ridge regression reduces the magnitude of the coefficients of the features in the model, leading to a simpler and more interpretable \n",
    "model. This can be particularly useful when working with high-dimensional datasets where there are many features that are potentially relevant to the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to OLS, Ridge regression tends to be less prone to overfitting, but it may introduce some bias into the estimates of the coefficients. Additionally, Ridge \n",
    "regression assumes that all features are relevant to the outcome, which may not be true in all cases. Overall, Ridge regression can be a useful tool in regression \n",

    "ans:\n",
    "The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to those of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations should be independent of each other. This assumption is important as it ensures that the model does not suffer from autocorrelation,\n",
    "which can lead to biased and inconsistent estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Ridge regression assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. Violation of this assumption \n",
    "can lead to biased and inconsistent estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The errors should be normally distributed with a mean of zero. This assumption is important as it allows us to make statistical inferences about the \n",
    "coefficients and the model as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: Ridge regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable \n",
