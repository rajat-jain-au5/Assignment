    "TensorFlow provides several data structures that are commonly used for building and working with deep learning models. Some of the key data structures in TensorFlow\n",
    "are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors: Tensors are the fundamental data structures in TensorFlow. They are multi-dimensional arrays of fixed-size homogeneous elements. Tensors can have any \n",
    "number of dimensions (rank) and store numerical data. Tensors are used to represent inputs, outputs, and intermediate values in a TensorFlow computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants: Constants are tensors whose values cannot be changed once defined. They are used to store fixed values such as hyperparameters, model architecture, or\n",
    "any other constant values required in the computation. Constants are typically used to store weights, biases, or other non-trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Variables are tensors whose values can be updated during training. They are commonly used to store the learnable parameters of a deep learning model, \n",
    "such as the weights and biases. Variables allow the model to learn and adapt its parameters based on the training data. Unlike constants, the values of variables\n",
    "can be modified using operations like gradient descent during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Placeholders: Placeholders are used to feed actual data into a TensorFlow computation graph during runtime. They are used when the actual values are not known at \n",
    "the time of defining the computation graph, such as during model training or inference. Placeholders act as input nodes and are filled with data using a feed \n",

    "Q3 Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "In TensorFlow, matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations can be performed using various functions and operators. Here's a description of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Matrix Addition: In TensorFlow, matrix addition can be performed using the tf.add() function or the + operator. It requires the matrices to have the same shape. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "    import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix1 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "matrix2 = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Matrix addition using tf.add()\n",
    "result = tf.add(matrix1, matrix2)\n",
    "print(result.numpy())  \n",
    "# [[6  8], [10 12]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Matrix addition using +\n",
    "result = matrix1 + matrix2\n",
    "print(result.numpy())  \n",
    "# [[6  8], [10 12]]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Matrix Multiplication: TensorFlow provides the tf.matmul() function to perform matrix multiplication. The function requires the inner dimensions of the matrices \n",
    "to match. For element-wise multiplication, you can use the * operator. For example:\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix1 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "matrix2 = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",

    "result = matrix1 * matrix2\n",
    "print(result.numpy())  \n",
    "# [[5 12], [21 32]]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Element-wise Operations: TensorFlow provides element-wise operations for tensors, which perform element-wise computations between tensors of the same shape. \n",
    "These operations include addition (tf.add() or +), subtraction (tf.subtract() or -), multiplication (tf.multiply() or *), division (tf.divide() or /), \n",
    "exponentiation (tf.pow() or **), and more. For example:\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",

    "tensor2 = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])\n",
