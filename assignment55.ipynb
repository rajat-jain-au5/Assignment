    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is a technique used in machine learning to search for the best hyperparameters of a model. Hyperparameters are parameters of\n",
    "a machine learning algorithm that are not learned from the data but are set by the user, such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers in a neural \n",
    "network, or regularization coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of grid search CV is to find the combination of hyperparameters that leads to the best performance of a model on a validation set. It works by\n",
    "exhaustively searching through a specified set of hyperparameters and evaluating the performance of the model for each combination of hyperparameters using \n",
    "cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid search algorithm creates a grid of all possible hyperparameter combinations based on the specified ranges or discrete values for each hyperparameter.\n",

    "best performance on the validation set are selected as the optimal hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of hyperparameters and the range of possible values are large. To address this \n",

    "ans:\n",
    "Grid search CV and randomized search CV are both techniques used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. The main difference between these two \n",

    "Avoid using future data: Make sure that the training dataset only contains information that was available at the time of prediction, and avoid including any \n",
